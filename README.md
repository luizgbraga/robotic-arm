# Robotic Arm (IPE1)

In the course Introduction to Engineering Projects (IPE1), we developed a robotic arm capable of transporting small polystyrene spheres from a support to a small cup. To achieve this, we integrated servo motors into a robotic arm constructed from popsicle sticks, screws, and drills.

Three motors were responsible for the arm's three-dimensional movement, while one managed the opening and closing of the claw that carried the small spheres.
